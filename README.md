**F1 Simulation üèéÔ∏è**
F1 Simulation is a racing management and live simulation platform where strategy meets speed. Players take on the role of team principals ‚Äî building their crew, upgrading facilities, and fine-tuning cars to compete in dynamic, real-time races.

It‚Äôs not just about driving ‚Äî it‚Äôs about running the whole operation. Every upgrade, every driver, and every pit crew decision counts.

**Overview**

Players create and manage their racing teams from the ground up. From recruiting skilled drivers and engineers to upgrading garages and improving car performance ‚Äî every choice influences race outcomes.

Once the lights go out, the platform shifts into a live simulation, where cars race on track in real time. Positions update with every tick, showing progress, overtakes, and strategy in motion.

Points are awarded based on finishing positions, contributing to a global leaderboard that tracks the best-performing teams and players.
